## What is it?
**PyTrack** is a Python package that integrates the recorded GPS coordinates with data provided by the open-source OpenStreetMap (OSM). 
PyTrack can serve the intelligent transport research, e.g. to reconstruct the video of a vehicleâ€™s route by exploiting available data and without equipping it with camera sensors, to update the urban road network, and so on.

## Main Features
The following are the main features that PyTrack includes:
- Generation of the street network graph using geospatial data from OpenStreetMap
- Map-matching
- Data cleaning
- Video reconstruction of the GPS route
- Visualisation and analysis capabilities

## Getting Started
### Installation
The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:
https://github.com/cosbidev/PyTrack.
PyTrack can be installed using*:
```sh
# conda
conda install pytrack 
```

```sh
# or PyPI
pip install PyTrack-lib
```
**for Mac m1 users, it is recommended to use conda in order to be able to install all dependencies.*
## Documentation
Checkout the official [documentation](https://pytrack-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
Besides, [here](https://github.com/cosbidev/PyTrack/tree/main/examples) you can see some examples of the application of the library.

## Examples
### Map-Matching
